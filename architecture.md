# Application Architecture

This application follows a modular architecture design to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## Overview

The application is structured into several key components that work together to provide the core functionality. Each component has a specific role and interacts with others through well-defined interfaces.

## Components

### 1. **Core Logic Layer**
- Contains the main business logic
- Handles data processing and transformation
- Implements the primary algorithms and functions

### 2. **Data Access Layer**
- Manages database connections and operations
- Provides abstraction for data storage and retrieval
- Handles data persistence and transactions

### 3. **User Interface Layer**
- Responsible for user interaction
- Processes user inputs and displays outputs
- Provides a clean, intuitive interface

### 4. **External Services Integration**
- Connects to third-party APIs and services
- Manages external communication protocols
- Handles service discovery and configuration

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the UI layer
2. Input is processed by the core logic layer
3. Data access layer retrieves/updates data as needed
4. External services are called when required
5. Results are returned to the user interface

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: [Programming Language/Framework]
- **Database**: [Database System]
- **APIs**: RESTful services with JSON payloads
- **External Services**: [Service Types]

This architecture allows for easy maintenance, testing, and future expansion of features.
